# About 榎本 優樹 (Enomoto Yuuki)

:jp:

I am Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) engineer. I am involved in FLOSS
in both my work and my spare time projects. My interest is how to manage
userland in NetBSD (yes, I am not kernel hacker) and how to get more efficiency
to testing packages/software. So, I love convenient and powerful software like
as package manager, container, virtual machine, configuration management tool,
and CI/CD tool.

## Projects

- [The NetBSD Project](https://www.netbsd.org/) to improve NetBSD base system packaging (syspkgs).
- [The pkgsrc-wip project](https://pkgsrc.org/wip/) to publish own software.
- [basepkg](https://github.com/user340/basepkg) for testing new features to NetBSD syspkgs.
- [fdgw2](https://github.com/user340/fdgw2) to try building small NetBSD distribution.
